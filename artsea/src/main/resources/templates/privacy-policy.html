            <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
            <p>Artsea Auction House Private Limited ("Artsea" or "Company") is a Company registered under the Companies Act, 2013 in India.</p>
            
            <p>When you buy and sell in our auctions or by private sale or purchase other services or goods from us, or when you take part in one of our events or attend a course or lecture in person, the controller of your data will be the Company.</p>
            
            <h2>2. How and when do we collect your personal data?</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Collection directly from you in response to our request</strong><br>
            Personal information is information, or a combination of pieces of information, that could reasonably allow you to be identified. As described in more detail below, we collect personal information about you from a variety of sources, including information we collect from you directly, information we collect about you from other sources, and information we collect automatically from you.</p>
            
            <p>We collect information that you submit to us or provide to us on forms available on third party websites. The types of information that we collect directly from you include: personal details (e.g., name, date of birth, alias and/or avatar alias), contact details (e.g., phone number, email address, postal address), transaction information (e.g., bidding or purchase records, shipping details, information about items you purchase or wish to consign), details about your collection, limited financial information (e.g., tokenized payment information in connection with your purchases, wire instructions, digital wallet details and address), username and password, user ID, unique device ID, information on forms required for certain transactions (e.g PAN, AADHAAR number, etc.), and identification information (e.g. photo ID).</p>
            
            <p>We rely on the information you provide to us or that we collect or observe about your individual interactions with us, for example, if you attend a live event, agree to sell or consign property, participate in one of our auctions, become a client, register or bid online.</p>
            
            <p>We may make video recordings of our auctions, gallery spaces, and certain live events. We record calls made to our customer care line for quality assurance, compliance purposes, and recordkeeping purposes.</p>
            
            <p>We may use common data collection technologies as you visit our websites or apps or interact with our emails. For example:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Our logs gather date, time, information about your browser and system or device configuration, information about how you interact with our digital properties, and an IP address for all visitors to our sites.</li>
                <li>If you have registered with us online, we use data collection technologies to collect information that indicates your individual interests in our websites, online platforms and apps, and your response to our emails and marketing campaigns.</li>
                <li>The Cookies and similar technologies on our digital platforms can also read and collect data about your browsers as you visit and interact with those platforms: please read our Cookie Policy for more detailed information about what cookies are, what kinds are used on our sites, and what choices you have. As described further in our Cookie Policy, we use these technologies to enable you to use our digital platforms, learn how you and others interact with our digital platforms, personalize the content on our digital platforms, and to deliver advertising based on your interests, including those inferred from your activities over time and across digital platforms operated by us and others.</li>
                <li>In general, our app will communicate data you provide about yourself, for example, registration, purchase, or bidding data, to our databases and systems. An app may, however, rely on other data collection technologies to recognize the device you use for viewing and to personalize your experience. If our app relies on additional data collection technologies that collect or use data about individual users, we will include additional notice either within the app or in a policy that accompanies it.</li>
                <li>We also use and allow certain other companies to use technologies that are similar to cookies (for example pixels and gifs) when we send you emails.</li>
            </ul>
